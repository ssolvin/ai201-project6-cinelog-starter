# PR Response Doc — CineLog Watchlist Feature

## AI Usage
<!-- Fill in at the end — how you used AI tools during this project -->

## Comment 1 — Rename: 
I notice watchlists default to public=True. We don't have a documented decision on default visibility for user lists. Before I can approve this, I need you to add a note to your PR description explaining your reasoning. I want to make sure we're being intentional here, not just inheriting a default.

**What I did:**
**How I verified:**

## Comment 2 — Deduplication: 
Please add a test for the case where film_id doesn't exist in the database. Look at the existing tests in test_collection.py — the pattern is there.

**What I did:**
**How I verified:**

## Comment 3 — Missing test:
save_to_watchlist() should follow the project's naming convention. Compare with add_to_collection() — the pattern here is verb_to_noun. Please rename to add_to_watchlist() and update all call sites.

**What I did:**
**How I verified:**

## Comment 4 — Default visibility:
What happens if a user calls this with a film that's already on their watchlist? The current implementation would add a duplicate entry. Please handle this case.

**My position:**
**Reasoning:**
**Tradeoff acknowledged:**

## Comment 5 — Sort order:
I'd prefer watchlists to default to "date added" order rather than alphabetical. Most users want to see what they added recently. I'm open to discussion if you see it differently — but let's make a decision and document it.

**My position:**
**Reasoning:**
**Engagement with reviewer's point:**

## Comment 6 — Rebase:
A refactor merged to main that changed film IDs from integers to UUIDs. Your watchlist code still references integer IDs. Please rebase on main and update accordingly.

**What conflicted:**
**How I resolved it:**
**How I verified no conflict remains:**
